## Who I'm
I'm new to the industry, looking for opportunities where I can be creative and intimate with my colleagues to share and gain knowledge. Committed to projects and causes that I identify with.
Enthusiast of projects involving everything that makes me creative !!! ~~artificial intelligence and data science~~.
In love with books, Brazilian music, learning new things and good teamwork!

Now, I work with Software Engineer, projecting architectures for Scraping for e-commerces around the world (and other sources), in my journey I learned techniques to increase performance and reduce daily collection costs, advanced techniques to circumvent site security, fast and frequent deliveries, and projection of a solid architectures using microservices to deliver any type of data to any client that needs.

Besides, I am having experience with Databases, working with pipeline constructions using microservices, a pipeline that feeds teams from different areas that involve everything from enrichment to the final product.

Investigation to Data modeling using Star Schema and 3FN where I understood the importance of putting the data in the first place, not tools.

I intend to plan my career to become a backend engineer, but all areas in computing attract me!!!
